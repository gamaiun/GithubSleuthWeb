This project was developed using Gatsby, a modern front-end framework built upon React. Styling was achieved using styled-components library. For navigation between pages, Gatsby's Link component was employed. The project features a responsive card component that scales in size based on user interactions. This dynamic behavior is achieved using React's state management and CSS transformations.
